Demand-Side Platform- Ad click rate prediction method

Here, I proposed a new method "From crowds to individual-A new Ad click prediction method". Now only a simple Chinese pdf available.

The approach can handle data sparsity, and trends of user interests. More specifically, the method uses ip interval tree to organize different size of crowds, and use reinforcement learning to expore click rate bounds.
